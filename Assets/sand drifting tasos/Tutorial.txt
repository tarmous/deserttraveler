board prefab setup:
{
	using:

	-rigidbody
	--no constraints (doesn't work well)
	--i want to find a more effective way to constraint Z-rotation

	-box collider 
	-- altered size and center

	-physics material

	-child object for visuals

	--collider box is higher than visual to give a better illusion of surfing

	sand drifting board script:
	{

		raycast points: 		used to check if board is grounded
		layer mask: 			used to make raycast ignore player
		max movement speed: 		the max speed the board can reach
		reach max speed in seconds:	<- this
		halt in seconds from max speed: <- also this
		Rotation rate:			degrees/sec (should be)

		Using:
		rigidbody.addtorgue ( a vector, ForceMode.velocityChange)
		rigidbody.addforce ( a vector, ForceMode.velocityChange)

		the force mode helps to configure the movement to our needs (ignoring mass/drag/etc)
